# Enforces invariant 9 of CLAUDE.md: a released binary can be rebuilt, by
# somebody who does not trust us, from the tag it claims to come from.
#
# WHY THIS IS WORTH A GATE RATHER THAN A SENTENCE
#
# Qryx is a scanner. Its whole pitch is that you point it at your own code,
# binaries, containers and KMS and believe what it reports. A buyer's security
# team is exactly the reader who should not have to take our binary on trust,
# and the answer to them is not "the source is open" (it always was) but "build
# it yourself and check you got the same bytes we published".
#
# That answer was already TRUE on 2026-08-05 and written down nowhere. The
# release workflow builds with CGO_ENABLED=0, -trimpath and -ldflags "-s -w",
# which is what makes it hold, and any one of those three going missing would
# break it silently: nothing fails, the binaries simply stop matching, and the
# only person who finds out is the one who tried to verify us.
#
# Measured that day, to be sure the claim is not aspirational:
#   published  qryx_v0.3.0_darwin_arm64 from the release page, built on an
#              ubuntu runner cross-compiling to darwin/arm64
#   local      the same tag, built on macOS
#   sha256     0864315d02b8580b56cb997e31b2bcef1bb804f4713981c0fae424ace3303c2b
# Different machine, different host OS, identical bytes.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT
#
# It builds the same target twice from two directories of DIFFERENT LENGTHS and
# refuses if a byte differs. Different lengths on purpose: two paths of the same
# length would hide a length-dependent embedding, which is the exact failure
# -trimpath exists to prevent.
#
# It proves PATH INDEPENDENCE, which is not the same statement as "this matches
# the release", and the two are worth keeping apart. It builds from `git
# archive`, so there is no `.git` and Go stamps no VCS metadata; the release is
# built in a checkout and IS stamped. The stamp is deterministic given the
# commit, so the release-matching claim in the README holds and was measured
# directly against the published artifact. This gate holds the property that
# makes that possible, on every push, without the network.
#
# HOW TO MEASURE THE STRONGER CLAIM, and the trap in doing it.
#
# Build in a real checkout at the tag: `git checkout v0.3.0 && go build ...`.
# NOT in a `git worktree --detach`, and NOT from a `git archive` extraction.
# Both of those leave Go unable to read the VCS, so it stamps no revision and
# records the module as `(devel)` instead of `v0.3.0`. The binary is then
# legitimately different from the release, and the difference looks enormous:
# `cmp -l` counts POSITIONS, so a version string one byte shorter shifts
# everything after it and reports megabytes of "differing bytes" for what is one
# changed field.
#
# That is worth writing down because it cost an afternoon and produced a wrong
# conclusion first. idryx was measured with the archive method, failed to match,
# and was written up as not reproducible. Built in a checkout at its tag it is
# byte-identical to its published artifact:
# 8c968574341f48775e898770e98cb586b620101668b86edec24428612e979a80. Both
# services reproduce. The method was broken, not the build.
#
# It cannot prove a different toolchain produces the same bytes. Go's output is
# tied to its compiler version, `go.mod` pins one, and a digest is only
# meaningful next to the version that made it, so both are printed.
#
# It also does not reach the network. Comparing against the published artifact
# would be a better test and a worse gate: it would fail on every commit after a
# release, which is every commit.
